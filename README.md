# Tyrian Misfits<br>Poking holes in walls since 2012

This is the [Tyrian Misfits website](http://www.tyrianmisfits.com), generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Contributing

The simplest way to request changes is to reach out to me in game or in Discord. If you have a GitHub account, you can also [file an issue](https://github.com/Tyrian-Misfits/website-source/issues).

Also if you have a GitHub account, you can fork the repository, make your changes ([see "Building" section below](#building)), commit those proposed changes, and [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

If you're an officer and want direct write access to the website, reach out to me directly.

## Building

### Most People

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. On GitHub.com, [fork the `Tyrian-Misfits/website-source` repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
4. On your computer, clone the forked repository: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT/website-source.git`.
5. From the newly created folder, start the Hugo server and make sure the site renders correctly: `hugo server`.
6. Make your changes and ensure that everything renders correctly.
7. Commit your changes and [submit the pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

### Repository Owners

If you have write access to the repositories, then you don't need to submit a pull request. You can push directly. Everything is the same up through step 6.

7. Run the `hugo` command to build the site into the `public` folder. If the changes were major, you may need to delete the previous material first.
8. Go into the `public` folder and commit and push the changes directly.
9. Commit and push the changes you made to the `website-source` repository as well.
