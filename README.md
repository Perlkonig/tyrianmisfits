# Tyrian Misfits<br>Poking holes in walls since 2012

This is the [Tyrian Misfits website](http://www.tyrianmisfits.com), generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Contributing

The simplest way to request changes is to reach out to me in game or in Discord. If you have a GitHub account, you can also [file an issue](https://github.com/Tyrian-Misfits/website-source/issues).

Also if you have a GitHub account, you can fork the repository, make your changes ([see "Building" section below](#building), commit those proposed changes, and [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

If you're an officer and want direct write access to the website, reach out to me directly.
