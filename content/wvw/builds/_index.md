TM does not require specific builds. Play classes you enjoy. That said, there *are* ideal builds for most classes that fill common roles WvW squads need. If you wish to start exploring those, the best place to start is an up-to-date build website. We recommend [GW2Mists](https://gw2mists.com/). In the Discord there are specific channels dedicated for discussions and questions around specific classes, and occasionally we hold class-specific training sessions.

Another site you will hear mentioned a lot is [MetaBattle](https://metabattle.com). While this site is helpful, it tends to lag behind the current "meta." What this site *does* have that GW2Mists does not are detailed explanations of how the builds work, including, often, rotation lists. Even if the build you go with does not perfectly match a MetaBattle build, their Usage sections will likely still be valuable.

## "Comp Night"

TM does run "comp nights" on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On those nights we run closed squads (members only) and practice our skills. Members who want to participate are encouraged to choose particular builds to form a diverse and well-tuned core group.

**Participation is voluntary!** We do not require members to play builds they don't want to play, and all members are welcome at each and every run.

Below are some articles on particular classes and builds we prefer. Builds listed on [GW2Mists](https://gw2mists.com/) are *always* acceptable. Custom builds, articles, and tutorial videos are listed below.
