GW2Mists lists [multiple guardian builds](https://gw2mists.com/builds/guardian). The most common, and the one we need for every single party in the zerg, is the Healbrand. The others can be slotted in to the flex spots, but they cannot replace a proper Healbrand.

## Healbrand

The core GW2Mists Healbrand build is perfectly serviceable, but there are minor variants.

### Frontline Aggressive (Commander)

This is the build our commander tends to run. You'll note the extra offensive mantras and the use of the axe, which gives a helpful pull when running down fleeing squirrels.

Firebrand commanders will still often have an additional firebrand in their party to ensure survivability.

### Boon Focused

Guardian healing will never compare with that of scrappers and even tempests. But guardians give a ton of helpful boons. So maximizing boon duration over healing power is also acceptable.

This build uses the standard mace for its defensive boons (skill #3 in particular) and Concentration sigils over Transference. It chooses Indomitable Courage over Battle Presence for the extra stability, and Magnanimous Maintenance Oil over the Bountiful for the extra boon duration (it is also significantly cheaper).

Rune of Water is a valid choice over Rune of the Monk.

### Utility Skills

You will almost always run at the very least Mantra of Liberation as your elite and Mantra of Lore. "Stand Your Ground!" is another staple.

Most heal slots are occupied with Mantra of Solace, but some do choose "Receive the Light!".

That leaves one slot that can change depending on party and enemy composition. Here are the most common choices:

* Hallowed Ground: Fire field that grants pulsing stability (and quickness and retaliation, with the right traits).
* Purging Flames: Pulsing fire damage and condition cleanse.
* Signet of Mercy: Passively increases boon duration and revives downed allies.
* Wall of Reflection: Long-lasting projectile reflect, particularly useful at choke points.

### Trait Options

Firebrand
:   The standard choice for Firebrand column 2 is Stalwart Speed. But it has a 7 second internal cooldown. If your party is getting quickness from elsewhere, Legendary Lore is a good alternative.

Honor
:   Even if you're not using a mace, Invigorated Bulwark is usually the best choice, but Protective Reviver is defensible without a mace.

    Pure of Voice is super helpful for "Stand Your Ground!", but Force of Will is acceptable if you need increased healing output.
