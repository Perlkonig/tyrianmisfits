You may hear the commander call out various words and phrases at certain points. Here's what they mean. Don't ever hesitate to ask, either in the chat or in Discord, if you have any questions or would like to see new terms added.

blast
:   This is usually called right after *stealth*. It means to use a [blast finisher](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blast_finisher) skill inside of a [smoke field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smoke_field) to create area stealth. See *stealth* for details.

finish the downs
:   Means to backtrack a little and be sure to finish all the of the downed enemies. This usually means "cleave," meaning do as much damage as you can. "Stomping" (pressing the Finish key) generally takes too long.

might up
:   This typically refers to the Guardian staff 4 skill [Empower](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Empower), but you can use [any skill that grants might](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Might) to allies.

pvd
:   Means "player vs. door." When called, it means to use your autoattack on the gate being sieged. We often do this if the gate is low and the rams have been disabled.

stack; stack up
:   It simply means get on tag. This is so, so important. Stealth, might, healing, all of it relies on people being close together. So stack up!

    When stacking, **always dismount**! Also, do not use any skills that create a [combo field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo) unless ordered to do so.

stealth
:   Some classes have skills that create a [smoke field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smoke_field). When smoke fields are [blasted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blast_finisher), they give stealth to people within the field. For this to work, you must keep in mind the following:

    * Hide your minatures in WvW. They don't stealth and give away our position.
    * Get off your mount. You can't stealth while mounted.
    * When stealth is called, do not use *any* skill that creates a [combo field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo) other than smoke! **This is so important!** Do not use *any* skill once stealth has been called unless you know what you're doing.
    * Once the smoke fields are down, if you have a blast finisher, use it immediately, but then do not use any other skill, to avoid revealing yourself.

sustain
:   Refers to skills that keep the group alive, such as healing, cleansing, and aegis.

water
:   Refers to healing. You might hear terms like "big water" vs. "small water." Big water means go all out. Small water typically means to save your big cooldowns and use whatever smaller heals you might have available.
