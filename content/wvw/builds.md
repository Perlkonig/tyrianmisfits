TM does not require specific builds. Play classes you enjoy. That said, there *are* ideal builds for most classes that fill common roles WvW squads need. If you wish to start exploring those, the best place to start is an up-to-date build website. We recommend [GW2Mists](https://gw2mists.de/). In the Discord there are specific channels dedicated for discussions and questions around specific classes, and occasionally we hold class-specific training sessions.

Another site you will hear mentioned a lot is [MetaBattle](https://metabattle.com). While this site is helpful, it tends to lag behind the current "meta." What this site *does* have that GW2Mists does not are detailed explanations of how the builds work, including, often, rotation lists. Even if the build you go with does not perfectly match a MetaBattle build, their Usage sections will likely still be valuable.

These build sites all include expensive infusions that can only be placed in ascended armour. *Exotic equipment is sufficient!* The stat difference between the two is around 10%&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;rarely enough to determine a fight. If you want to start building an ascended equipment set, start with the trinkets, which are cheaper to get. Then work on your armor and weapons. Remember that aside from crafting, you can also buy ascended gear with the currency you earn by playing WvW. Infusions are "luxury" items you can look at adding to your build much later on.
