# Equipment

Exotic equipment is sufficient for World vs. World. The stat difference between exotic and ascended gear is around 10%&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;rarely enough to determine a fight. And by playing WvW you will naturally earn [Warlord's Armor Boxes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warlord%27s_Armor_Box), which give you stat-selectable exotic armour. For a discussion of which stats you want on your equipment, please see the [Builds](../builds) article.

If you want to start building an ascended equipment set, start with the trinkets, which are cheaper to get. Then work on your armor and weapons. Remember that aside from crafting, you can also buy ascended gear with the currency you earn by playing WvW. 

On various build sites, you will also see recommended [infusions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infusion). These are luxury items you can look at adding to your build much later on. You do not need to worry about these until your ascended sets are complete. You can buy the infusions with laurels or skirmish tickets.
