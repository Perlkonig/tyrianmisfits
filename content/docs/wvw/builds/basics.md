# The Basics

The core party composition is a support firebrand (primarily for stability), a scrapper (for healing), and a scourge (for condi damage, shields, and boon rips). The remaining two slots is where we can get creative.

At its most simplistic, builds are described in terms of role (DPS vs. support) and position (frontline vs. backline).

## Role

In an ideal comp, nobody is a one-trick pony. But it's important to know what your primary role is. It guides all the decisions you make.

DPS builds run stats that focus on damage, which makes them squishy, and their choice of utility skills will generally lean towards maximizing damage.

Support builds run stats that focus on healing and boon duration, and their job is to allow the DPSers to do the maximum amount of damage.

Yes there are hybrid builds, but in a solid comp, you will generally favour specialists over generalists. It's simply more effective.

## Position

Frontline builds are designed to be right in the thick of things; they're tanky. Frontline DPS builds focus on burst damage and CC, keeping enemies occupied and away from the back line. Frontline support builds typically provide offensive boons and conditions to help the DPSers do as much damage as possible in a push.

Backline builds hold back, but just a little. Unless you have supports dedicated to you, it's important to stay within, say, 900 units of the tag. That's where most of the support is focused.

Backline DPS builds focus on ranged weapons and can typically do massive amounts of damage, but they tend to crumble in a frontal assault. Backline supports will help with reflects and other defensive boons to keep the back line mobile and effective.
