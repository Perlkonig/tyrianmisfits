# Revenant

[GW2Mists only lists a single zerg build for revenant](https://gw2mists.com/builds/revenant): the power herald.

## Power Herald (Backline)

[Power Herald](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAIxzlpQHMLyhdRNMM6hJSfsCKgJ/lZzG-zVRYBh7TMqRglSTRQmhQEFQFJgtHgA2DvF9PjA-w)

Build variations: If and only if you are consistently top three in DPS do I recommend taking Notoriety (devastation tree) over Assassin's Presence. Brutality and Swift Termination are also interchangeable, but I recommend Brutality if you're new to Herald.

The GW2Mists build takes Herald: Draconic Echo, but the recommended trait is Herald: Forceful Persistence.

### Group Role

Herald's role in WvW is to output burst damage. While classes like weaver can have better sustained damage and better cleave damage, they cannot match a herald's burst. A good stealth bomb from multiple heralds can win fights before they even really begin by securing several downs immediately.

### Skill Notes

Swap legends as much as possible. Don't camp one legend for too long unless a cooldown like Elemental Blast/Inspiring Reinforcement is close to being ready.

I recommend keeping on Facet of Elements, Facet of Darkness, and Facet of Strength. The boons these provide are very strong, and give you additional damage through Forceful Persistence. If your party's sustain is lacking you can toggle on Facet of Light instead of Facet of Strength to bypass Infuse Light's cast time.

When on Dwarf, **always use True Nature Dwarf**! It has a quarter-second cast time and doesn't cost any energy. It provides three stacks of stability for four-and-a-half seconds. USE IT A LOT!

The trait Herald: Forceful Persistence gives you 13% more damage when you have upkeep (e.g., facets on, Vengeful Hammers on). Try to have some type of upkeep when you use big skills like Coalescence of Ruin, Phase Smash, and Inspiring Reinforcement.

### Rotations

#### DPS

Hammer is Herald's primary DPS weapon and should be camped 95% of the time in WvW. Sword/sword should only be used during prolonged melee engagements (10s+), or when the commander calls for melee. If your group is passing through the enemy group and not staying in melee, do *not* switch to sword/sword. 

Coalescence of Ruin (hammer 2), Phase Smash, Elemental Blast, and Inspiring Reinforcement are your bread and butter DPS skills.

Never use Phase Smash without upkeep skills toggled (e.g., facets, or jalis hammers). Forceful Persistence gives you 13% extra damage for having upkeep.

#### From Stealth

Coalescence of Ruin (Hammer 2) > Elemental Blast > legend swap to dwarf > Inspiring Reinforcement. Then, *as long as it doesn't put you out of position*, Vengeful Hammers (for Forceful Persistence) > Phase Smash (Hammer 3). But remember, a dead player's DPS is zero.

After this combo stay in Jalis until you can use another Inspiring Reinforcement and then swap to Glint.

After your opening combo use Coalescence of Ruin off of cooldown and Inspiring Reinforcement/Elemental Blast off of cooldown. Always open with Inspiring Reinforcement when you swap to Jalis so you can use the skill twice before swapping back to Glint.
