# Revenant

[GW2Mists only lists a single zerg build for revenant](https://gw2mists.com/builds/revenant): the power herald.

## Power Herald (Backline)

[Power Herald](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmxAIxzlpQHMLyhdRNMM6hJSfsCKgJ/lZzG-z1QYho+DcH0Xh0UUVXCURpa7BIg/W0fGA-w)

**Gear:** Use a mixture of Berserker’s and Assassin’s gear. Your goal is to get your crit chance to 60% so you will have a 100% crit rate when you have fury. The trait Rolling Mists doubles the effectiveness of fury, resulting in fury granting you 40% additional crit chance.

**Build variations:** If and only if you are consistently top three in DPS do I recommend taking Devastation: Notoriety over Assassin's Presence. Brutality and Swift Termination are also interchangeable, but I recommend Brutality if you're new to Herald.

### Group Role

Herald’s role in WvW is to output burst damage from range, which no other class can do quite as effectively. Herald also provides incredible damage reduction from skills such as Rite of the Great Dwarf and True Nature Dwarf, and our boon uptime is unmatched by other DPS classes. While classes like weaver can have better sustained damage and better cleave damage, they cannot match a herald’s burst. A good stealth bomb from multiple heralds can win fights before they even really begin by securing several downs immediately.

### Commander Calls to Listen For

"Range out", "1200s", "range bomb", "range spike", etc. all mean the same thing to a Herald: Phase Smash wherever the commander has a marker at. If the spike results in downs, then follow up with a Coalescence of Ruin.

"Superspeed" cast Chaotic Release (Glint’s elite). This is the only real use for this skill.

“CCs out” use hammer 5 (Drop the Hammer) on the marked location.

### Skill Notes

Swap legends as much as possible. Don't camp one legend for too long unless a cooldown like Elemental Blast/Inspiring Reinforcement is close to being ready (three seconds from being ready at the most).

I recommend starting in Glint and initiating fights with Facet of Elements, Facet of Darkness, and Facet of Strength. The boons these provide are extraordinarily strong and give you additional damage through Forceful Persistence.

When on Dwarf, **always use True Nature Dwarf**! It has a quarter-second cast time and doesn't cost any energy. It provides three stacks of stability for four-and-a-half seconds. USE IT A LOT! On the other hand, True Nature Glint is worthless except for using it to activate Forceful Persistence.

The trait Herald: Forceful Persistence gives you 13% more damage when you have upkeep (e.g., facets on, Vengeful Hammers on). Try to have some type of upkeep when you use big skills like Coalescence of Ruin, Phase Smash, and Inspiring Reinforcement.

Burst of Strength only applies its 7% damage buff if you hit an enemy with it (this one is for you, Dark).

Rite of the Great Dwarf (Jalis elite) is incredibly strong and expensive. Use it in situations when you can afford to use it, or if it’s available and you’re about to swap to Glint.

### Rotations

#### DPS

Hammer is Herald's primary DPS weapon and should be camped 95% of the time in WvW. Sword/sword should only be used during prolonged melee engagements (10s+), or when the commander calls for melee. If your group is passing through the enemy group and not staying in melee, do *not* switch to sword/sword.

Your main DPS skills are: Coalescence of Ruin, Phase Smash, Elemental Blast, and Inspiring Reinforcement. Try to have Forceful Persistence active while using these skills.

Vengeful Hammers should be toggled when available and passing through blobs.

#### From Stealth

Elemental Blast > legend swap to dwarf > Coalescence of Ruin > Inspiring Reinforcement. Then, *if it does not put you out of position*, True Nature (for Forceful Persistence) > Phase Smash. But remember, a dead player’s DPS is zero.

After this combo stay in Jalis until you can use another Inspiring Reinforcement and then swap to Glint.

After your opening combo use Coalescence of Ruin off of cooldown and Inspiring Reinforcement/Elemental Blast off of cooldown. Always open with Inspiring Reinforcement when you swap to Jalis so you can use the skill twice before swapping back to Glint.
