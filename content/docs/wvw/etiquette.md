# Etiquette

Running with a squad is like a team sport. To be successful, everyone should understand the fundamentals and adhere to certain basic "rules." These basic rules of etiquette apply to any squad you may find yourself in.

1) Stay on tag. We cannot stress this enough. If you can't see the tag, you are probably in the wrong place.

    * Trust your commander. Even if the lord is at 5%, if the tag says to follow, do it. It might be a mistake, but you only hurt the commander's plan by not being there when they need you. Commanders do make mistakes. It's OK. It's how we learn.

    * When you are not on tag, you create a "tail." This means that when a fight is engaged, not everybody will be there at the same time. This can lead to avoidable wipes.

    * When you are not on tag and you have supply, then our count of available supply will be off. This can lead to wasted siege or dangerous delays that can lead to wipes.

    * There are roamers that follow squads just to pick off their tails. As the saying goes, "If you're not on tag, you're a bag." It is much safer to be with the main body of the squad.

2) Don't "squirrel." This is the main reason people end up off tag, and often end up dead. Squirreling is when you leave the group to go after an enemy. If you want to roam, that's totally fine! But then you should leave the squad. If you are *in* the squad, you should be *with* the squad.

    If you do chose to squirrel and find yourself in trouble, please do not call out for help. We can't be turning around a 30-man squad to chase one roamer. Chalk it up to experience and make your way back to the tag as quickly as you can.

3) Be in voice comms if you can. You should not feel pressured to participate. You can mute. But it is very helpful if you can hear what the commander is saying. If you can't join voice, do be very attentive to squad chat and where the tag is going.

4) Keep voice comms clear during fights. The live banter is the heart and soul of a guild run. We love it! But when things get hot, please put down the conversation and give the commander the room not just to think but to communicate clearly to the rest of the squad.

5) If you are defeated, unless victory is imminent, waypoint and make your way back to squad as quickly as you can.

6) Never throw siege. This is the commander's sole prerogative.

7) When sieging an objective, here's the order of operations:

    * First clear enemy rams or catapults in the way.
    * Then build any siege the commander drops. And build fast! If you have supply, and you see something that needs building, build it!
    * If you are a healer or support with reflects, stay with the siege and protect it.
    * If you have ranged damage, clear the walls of guards, siege, and squirrels.
    * Otherwise, if you have siege mastery, use any available siege.
    * Everyone else, see rule #1.

8) Don't claim objectives unless told to. Please leave that decision up to the commander or delegate.

9) Hide your miniatures when in WvW. They don't stealth and give away our position.

10) When stacking, get off your mount unless the commander tells you to mount up. You can't stealth while mounted.

11) When the commander calls "stealth", stop using *any* skills unless you *know* they won't interfere. See the [Commander Calls page](/wvw/calls) for more details.
