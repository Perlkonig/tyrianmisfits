# PvP 101

There are a handful of Misfits who really enjoy the PvP game mode. If you enjoy WvW fighting, than you may become one of them! PvP is the most exciting parts of WvW distilled to its purest form and shot directly into your veins. You'll be hooked!

PvP can be very daunting at first, but it needn't be. Though it does require a certain mental Zen. Here are some articles to get you started. Don't hesitate to reach out on the Discord PvP channel with questions.

## Why PvP?

Other than because it's tremendously fun? Here are a few more reasons to explore this game mode:

* There are a lot of achievement points you can get, including relatively simple ones like the jumping puzzle and collections.
* PvP has reward tracks! (See the [PvP Screen article](./screen) for more details.) *You can even redo the one-time-only tracks that give you bonus clovers!!*
* Three of the four PvP dailies are quite easy to do and net you reward track potions.
* There are a number of PvP-only legendaries you can earn:
  * [The Ascension](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ascension) (back item)
  * [Transcendence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transcendence) (amulet)
  * [Armour sets in all three weights](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor#PvP_Components)
* Finally, if you enjoy WvW, PvP practice will dramatically improve your WvW play. It is really amazing what a difference it can make.
