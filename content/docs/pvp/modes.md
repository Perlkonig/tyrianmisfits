# Game Modes

## Conquest

[Conquest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Conquest) is the primary PvP mode. There are nine different maps with three control nodes each. Each also has a unique mechanic&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;some of which earn you points directly, others of which grant various bonuses.

* Two teams of five battle it out.
* The winner is either the first team to 500 points or the team with the most points after 15 minutes.
* You earn 5 points for every kill.
* Every 2 seconds, you earn 1 point per node owned.
* You take control of a node by standing within the circle.
  * If there is an enemy in the circle with you, nothing happens.
  * If you are alone in the circle and it belongs to the enemy, you will slowly "decap" the node.
  * If you are alone in the circle and it's neutral, then the node will slowly become yours.
* As long as a node has not been neutralized, it will still earn your team points, even if it's being actively contested.

### Mental Health Hygiene

Playing with strangers can be frustrating. In PvE, the game is designed to minimize griefing and toxicity. In WvW, griefing is common, but communication is blocked, and you can run in larger groups for protection. In PvP, however, not only are you in direct competition with strangers and have minimal control over who you play with, all communication channels are open.

If you're the type of person that loves the trash talking game and isn't bothered by it, then great. You've found your home.

For those of us who find such communication bothersome, we recommend creating a chat tab that only contains `/team` chat and disabling world chat bubbles. And don't hesitate to block anybody toxic on your team or anyone who whispers you.

### Keep Perspective

* **Find the fun and focus on it.** It's a game; it's supposed to be fun. If you're not having fun, take a break. If you find yourself wanting to come back, understand what it is that's drawing you in and focus on that as you play.

* **Be kind to yourself.** GW2 has one of the deepest combat systems of any MMORPG, and the skill ceiling is actually quite high. You *will* find yourself on the receiving end of a massive whooping and be left asking "how the heck did they do that"? Be patient and know that focused effort and practice *will* make you a better player.

* **At the same time, you can only control yourself.** You're going to encounter frustrating bots. You're going to run into players who go AFK or win trade. And you're also going to be grouped with people who are trying but are simply worse players than you. Yes this is frustrating, but if you want to improve, don't blame them for your loss. You can't do anything about them. Focus on what *you* did well and on what *you* can improve. There's always something.

### Gameplay Essentials

1. **Don't die.** After you die, there's a 15-second cooldown before you respawn. This gives the enemy team a massive advantage. Yes, you're going to die&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a lot in the beginning&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but the first thing you should learn how to do is die less. Your goal is to die no more than three times in any given match. Learn what your class's disengage skills are (the skills that let you get away from a fight). Learn how to use the terrain to find reprieve and heal up. Learn when it's time to get the heck out and when it's truly your time to take a stand.
1. **Focus on the nodes.** This is a more accurate translation of the advice "Fight on point!" that you will hear shouted in games time and time again. Games are usually won by consistent control of the nodes (you consistently have more nodes than the enemy does).
   * If you're near a node you don't own, you want to be within that circle as much as you safely can (but see rule #1).
   * If you're defending your own node, then fighting "off point" is exactly what you want. You want to keep them off your node as long as you can. If they'll let you kite them around, great.
   * If you find yourself fighting for no reason in the middle of nowhere, you're likely in the wrong place. Disengage and go do some good.
1. **Be aware of your surroundings.** Tunnel vision will get you killed. Always be aware of what's going on around you. How many of them are there? Any more coming? What are your teammates doing? What terrain is available for when things get rough?
1. **Check your minimap constantly.** Learning to read your minimap and checking it often is another essential skill. Your teammates are always visible, and any enemies near them will also be visible. When you're not sure what to do, check the minimap. What nodes do you own? Where is everybody? What's the score? These will all inform your decision.
1. **Maximize your value.** This is the definition of becoming a better PvP player. Understand your role (see the [Builds article](../builds)), and learn what to do in any given moment that will earn your team the most points. Here are some general principles that might help:
   * Don't start an outnumbered fight. Unless you *know* you will win, walk away.
   * If you *become* outnumbered at a node, then your best option is usually to keep them there and occupied as long as possible to give your team the advantage at other nodes. Use terrain to extend your life. Sometimes disengaging is sensible, but if you can keep yourself alive for a good while, then dragging out the inevitable is often the best call.
   * The corollary to this is, if you see a teammate outnumbered at a node, depending on your role and theirs, it may be best to leave them there! If it's 2v1 at that node, it means it's 3v4 everywhere else. Take advantage of that.
   * Remember that you can only control yourself. If you find yourself in a situation that doesn't match your role, get the heck out and make yourself useful.
