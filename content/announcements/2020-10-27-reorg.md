We are going through a reorganization. The goals are as follows:

* Simplify our structure
* Communicate that structure consistently to all members
* Create and maintain a space for new members to get this information later (this website)
* Most importantly, distribute the leadership load among more people to ensure our continued sustainability

Please review the website closely, particularly the [Guild Structure section](/#guild-structure), and let us know in Discord if you have any questions or concerns. Most existing Knight and Crusader Misfits will be moved to Misfit. Some, depending on needs, will be moved to Champion. The changes will be implemented sometime on or after October 30th.
